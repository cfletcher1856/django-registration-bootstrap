Based on https://github.com/yourcelf/django-registration-defaults using Twitters Bootstrap

Django 1.5 ready now!

django-registration-bootstrap
=============================
James Bennet's django-registration is awesome. But it doesn't come with any of the 15 templates required to implement the workflow of registration, login/logout, and password changing and resetting. This application simply provides a set of default templates for this to avoid the repetition of rewriting them.

This app is supplemental to django-registration, which must also be installed.
